\subsection{Connect Server and client}

\subsubsection{Server code}

\subsection{Allow multiple clients}

\subsubsection{Client 1 terminal}

\subsubsection{Client 2 terminal}

\subsubsection{Explanation}
The server currently only accepts one connection from one client.
That is why client 1 can communicate with the server without issues.
When client 2 tried to connect, it got stuck because the server did not call the \textit{accept()} method again.

\subsubsection{Server code modified}

\subsubsection{Server terminal}

The server is now able to accept connections from both clients.

\subsection{Explanation of Exercise 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{How many processes and threads are created by the server program?} \newline
        There is still only one server process, but now it creates two threads to handle both connecting clients.
    \item \textbf{What are the IP address(es) and port number(s) of these process(es) and thread(s).} \newline
        
    \item \textbf{In the beginning, what is problem with client-2? After modification, why can client-2 connect to the server?}
\end{itemize}
